=head1 NAME

Business::US::USPS::IMB - Perl Binding for usps4cp

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Business::US::USPS::IMB;

  my ($bar_string, $result_code) = encode_IMB($track_code, $route_code);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an interface to usps4cp, providing access to USPS Intelligent Mail Barcode encoder functionality
provided by this library. You will need the correct fonts in order to create actual barcodes. This module only
provides a correctly formatted encoding string, not the actual barcode.

For more information on this library see the following documentation:

This function takes a tracking number and routing number as parameters and returns a barcode string and result code.
If something went wrong, the barcode string will be undef.

Possible result codes and their explaintions are:

SUCCESS                           0
SELFTEST_FAILED                   1
BAR_STRING_IS_NULL                2
BYTE_CONVERSION_FAILED            3
RETRIEVE_TABLE_FAILED             4
CODEWORD_CONVERSION_FAILED        5
CHARACTER_RANGE_ERROR             6
TRACK_STRING_IS_NULL              7
ROUTE_STRING_IS_NULL              8
TRACK_STRING_BAD_LENGTH           9
TRACK_STRING_HAS_INVALID_DATA    10
TRACK_STRING_HAS_INVALID_DIGIT2  11
ROUTE_STRING_BAD_LENGTH          12
ROUTE_STRING_HAS_INVALID_DATA    13
